The Tandem Select jQuery Plugin implments tandem, or two stage, select menus in web forms using jQuery and JavaScript.

A standard HTML multiple Select menu allows the user to select multiple options using Command-Click. But when the list of options is long, requiring the user to scroll, it becomes cumbersome and prone to errors.

An effective solution is to use two select menus in tandem, with buttons allowing options to be swapped between the two.
